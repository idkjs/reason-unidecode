# unidecode

Convert unicode strings into its ASCII representation.

The purpose of this library is the same as python's
[unidecode](https://pypi.org/project/Unidecode/) library (version
1.1.1).

Code of the initial release of this library has been extracted from
[GeneWeb](https://github.com/geneweb/geneweb) and adapted to be
released in an independent library.

## Installation

```bash
opam install unidecode
```
```bash
npm install reason-unidecode

## License

Released under the terms of the [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Limitations

- Only supports NFC normalization form.
- Transliteration targets french language
  (i.e. russian `у` gives `ou` while `u` could be expected).
  This will eventually be parameterizable.
- Transliteration might produce strange casing
  (e.g. `У` produce `OU` while `Ou` could be expected).
  Choosing between default (current) behavior, lower casing, upper
  casing, and capitalization will eventually be an option.

dune build            # build the library
dune install          # install the built library
dune clean            # clean compilation artifacts
dune runtest          # run unit tests
dune build @runbench  # compare with other libs
